# Predicting Product Re-Orders On Instacart
- Predicted which products each Instacart user will buy in the next order given a history of orders using classification algorithms and engineering time-based features to optimize F1 score. 
- Logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosted trees models were trained and evaluated. 
- XGBoost was selected and trained on the full training data on AWS, and performed an F1 of 0.440 on the test set. 
- The ~8 million product orders from Kaggle were stored in postgreSQL and results visualized with Tableau.
